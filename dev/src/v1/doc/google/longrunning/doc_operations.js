/**
 * This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a
 * network API call.
 *
 * @property {string} name
 *   The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that
 *   originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the
 *   `name` should have the format of `operations/some/unique/name`.
 *
 * @property {Object} metadata
 *   Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.  It typically
 *   contains progress information and common metadata such as create time.
 *   Some services might not provide such metadata.  Any method that returns a
 *   long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Any]{@link
 * google.protobuf.Any}
 *
 * @property {boolean} done
 *   If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress.
 *   If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is
 *   available.
 *
 * @property {Object} error
 *   The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Status]{@link
 * google.rpc.Status}
 *
 * @property {Object} response
 *   The normal response of the operation in case of success.  If the original
 *   method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is
 *   `google.protobuf.Empty`.  If the original method is standard
 *   `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For other
 *   methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx`
 *   is the original method name.  For example, if the original method name
 *   is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is
 *   `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Any]{@link
 * google.protobuf.Any}
 *
 * @typedef Operation
 * @memberof google.longrunning
 * @see [google.longrunning.Operation definition in proto format]{@link https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/longrunning/operations.proto}
