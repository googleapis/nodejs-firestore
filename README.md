This is the Node.js Server SDK for 
[Google Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/). Google
Cloud Firestore is a NoSQL document database built for automatic scaling, high
performance, and ease of application development.

This Cloud Firestore Server SDK uses Googleâ€™s [Cloud Identity and Access
Management](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/security/iam) for
authentication and should only be used **in trusted environments**. Your Cloud
Identity credentials allow you bypass all access restrictions and provide read
and write access to all data in your Cloud Firestore project.

The Cloud Firestore Server SDKs are designed to manage the full set of data in
your Cloud Firestore project and work best with reliable network connectivity.
Data operations performed via these SDKs directly access the Cloud Firestore
backend and all document reads and writes are optimized for high throughput.

Applications that use Google's Server SDKs should not be used in end-user
environments, such as on phones or on publicly hosted websites. If you are
developing a Web or Node.js application that accesses Cloud Firestore on behalf
of end users, use the [`firebase`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase)
Client SDK.

## Quickstart

Read more about the client libraries for Cloud APIs, including the older
Google APIs Client Libraries, in [Client Libraries Explained][explained].

### Before you begin

1.  Select or create a Cloud Platform project.

    [Go to the projects page][projects]

1.  Enable the Google Cloud Firestore API.

    [Enable the API][enable_api]

1.  [Set up authentication with a service account][auth] so you can access the
    API from your local workstation.

[projects]: https://console.cloud.google.com/project
[enable_api]: https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=firestore.googleapis.com
[auth]: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started

### Installing the client library

    npm install --save @google-cloud/firestore

### Using the client library

```javascript
const Firestore = require('@google-cloud/firestore');

const firestore = new Firestore({
  projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
  keyFilename: '/path/to/keyfile.json',
});

const document = firestore.doc('posts/intro-to-firestore');

// Enter new data into the document.
document.set({
  title: 'Welcome to Firestore',
  body: 'Hello World',
}).then(() => {
  // Document created successfully.
});

// Update an existing document.
document.update({
  body: 'My first Firestore app',
}).then(() => {
  // Document updated successfully.
});

// Read the document.
document.get().then(doc => {
  // Document read successfully.
});

// Delete the document.
document.delete().then(() => {
  // Document deleted successfully.
});
```


The [Cloud Firestore Node.js Client API Reference][client-docs] documentation
also contains samples.

## Versioning

This library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

This library is considered to be in **beta**. This means it is expected to be
mostly stable while we work toward a general availability release; however,
complete stability is not guaranteed. We will address issues and requests
against beta libraries with a high priority.
